'some' + 'more'
'somemore'
This is the result in the console window.


typeof 2
'number'
This function tells us the type of value.

'hello' + 3
'hello3'
Concatenation converts everything into a string.

What if we wanted to do math with strings....

'$' + 20.95 + 7.99
'$20.957.99'
This doesn't look right.
We have to put the numbers in parenthesis.

'$' + (2095 + 799) / 100

Let's write out the code for the item line...

'Items (' + (1+1) + '): $' + (2095+799 / 100)
'Items (2): $28.94'
